Sure! Here’s a cheatsheet with key points and Excel functions for your practical test on Sampling Distribution, Estimation, Hypothesis Testing, and Linear Regression:

### Sampling Distribution

**Central Limit Theorem:**
- For large sample sizes (\(n \geq 30\)), the sample mean distribution will be approximately normal, regardless of the population distribution.

### Estimation

**Confidence Intervals:**
- **Sample size \(n < 30\) (Unknown Population Standard Deviation):**
  - Use `CONFIDENCE.T(alpha, standard_dev, size)`
  - Example: `=CONFIDENCE.T(0.05, STDEV.S(A2:A41), 29)`
- **Sample size \(n \geq 30\) (Known Population Standard Deviation):**
  - Use `CONFIDENCE.NORM(alpha, standard_dev, size)`
  - Example: `=CONFIDENCE.NORM(0.05, 230, 40)`

### Hypothesis Testing

**p-value Decision Rule:**
- If \( p \leq 0.05 \), reject \(H_0\) (significant result).
- If \( p > 0.05 \), fail to reject \(H_0\) (not significant).

**t-Test (Small Sample, Unknown \(\sigma\)):**
- Use `T.TEST(array1, array2, tails, type)`
  - Example: `=T.TEST(A2:A11, B2:B11, 2, 2)` (two-tailed, two-sample)

**z-Test (Large Sample or Known \(\sigma\)):**
- Use `Z.TEST(array, x, sigma)`
  - Example: `=Z.TEST(A2:A51, 2700, 230)`

### Linear Regression

**Steps to Perform Linear Regression in Excel:**
1. Go to `Data` > `Data Analysis` > `Regression`.
2. Input your dependent variable (Y Range) and independent variable (X Range).
3. Check `Labels` if you have column headers.
4. Choose an output range or new worksheet.
5. Click `OK`.

**Key Outputs to Note:**
- **Regression Equation:** \( Y = a + bX \)
  - Intercept (a): From the `Coefficients` section
  - Slope (b): From the `Coefficients` section
- **Correlation Coefficient (r):**
  - Calculate from R-squared: \( r = \sqrt{R^2} \)
- **Coefficient of Determination (R²):**
  - Found in the `Regression Statistics` section

### Generic Statements for Hypothesis Testing:

**If p-value \(\leq 0.05\):**
"Since the p-value is less than or equal to 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis (\(H_0\)). This means there is sufficient evidence to support the alternative hypothesis (\(H_1\)) at the 5% significance level."

**If p-value > 0.05:**
"Since the p-value is greater than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis (\(H_0\)). This means there is not enough evidence to support the alternative hypothesis (\(H_1\)) at the 5% significance level."

### Summary Template for Linear Regression:

**Correlation Coefficient:**
"The correlation coefficient (r) is [value], indicating a [strength] [direction] linear relationship between \(X\) and \(Y\)."

**Regression Equation:**
"The regression equation is \( Y = [Intercept] + [Slope]X \). This means that for every unit increase in \(X\), \(Y\) [increases/decreases] by [Slope] units."

**Coefficient of Determination (R²):**
"The coefficient of determination (R²) is [value], meaning that [percentage]% of the variance in \(Y\) can be explained by \(X\). This suggests a [quality of fit] fit of the regression model to the data."

### Quick Tips:
- **Excel Shortcuts:**
  - `STDEV.S(range)` for sample standard deviation
  - `STDEV.P(range)` for population standard deviation
  - `AVERAGE(range)` for mean
  - `=CONFIDENCE.T(0.05, STDEV.S(range), size)` for confidence interval (small sample)
  - `=CONFIDENCE.NORM(0.05, standard_dev, size)` for confidence interval (large sample)

Keep this cheatsheet handy during your test for quick reference. Good luck!
